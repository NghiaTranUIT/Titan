# Titan
Postgresql client for macOS/iOS. Clean design. Absolutely 100% Free and open-source.

## Why postgresql ?
At this time I'm wirting. I'm working at Pixai project (feels.com) as full-stack position.  
Go for backend. React-FB and redux for frontend, ...
It's pretty suck when I tried to find best postgresql client on macOS.  
*Postico* is the best one I found, but it's missing  multi-tab, multi-connection in free version.  
*pgAdmin III* are the worst , GUI  seem like from 20s, and only non-retina support. 
After tried  and deleted many similar client.  
Finally, I prefers *PSequel*, clean design, straight-forward GUI, but it's still buggy sometime, and didn't support multi-tab too.

So  ðŸ¤”  

I decied to write my own Postgresql client - called as Titan.  
It's best time to apply what I learn to real product.
