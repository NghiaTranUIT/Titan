Why?
------------
  
At this time I'm wirting. I'm working at Pixai project (feels.com) as full-stack developer.  
Go-lang for backend. React-FB and redux for frontend, ...
  
It's pretty struggle when I tried to find best postgresql client on macOS.
  
*Postico* is the best one I found, but it's missing  multi-tab, multi-connection in free version.  
*pgAdmin III* are the worst , GUI  seem like from 80s, and non-retina support.
  
After tried  and deleted many similar clients.  
Finally, I prefers *PSequel*, clean design, straight-forward GUI, but it's still buggy sometime, and didn't support multi-tab too.

So  ðŸ¤”
  
I decied to write my own Postgresql client - called as **Titan**.
  
It's best time to apply what I learn to real product.

Technologies
------------
  
It's whole new project, I intent to apply what I'm learning.
  
*   Cross-framework  - supported iOS and macOS too
*   ReSwift (Redux)
*   ~~RxSwift + MVVM~~ -> I decied to get rid of RxSwift, Rx...stuff, and MVVM (binding)
'cause it's too hard to understand, maintain, implemente new features,.. for the fresher or the guy who take responsibility of this projct in future.
*   Clearn Swift architecture: VIP model
*   Networking abstraction layer
*   Postgresql-driver abstraction layer
*   Swift 3.0
*   Realm
*   ...
