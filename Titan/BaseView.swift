// MARK: - Override awakeFromNib
/// We shouldn't create too many BaseView like what we did before.
/// It's redundancy if we create many BaseView, ex: BaseView, BaseCollectionViewCell, BaseTableViewCell, ...
/// Just conform BaseAbility
/// Less code - less bug

/*
 # Tried 1
 
 - Extension default implement for all BaseAbility's methods
 -> Problem: Subclass of NSViewController can't override method from protocol
 
 
 # Tried 2
 
 - Convert it's to optional
 - So we don't need to implement BaseAbility's protocol
 -> Problem: optional only support in @objs protocl, and @objc method.
 But the real struggle is, @objc protocol doesn't support Extension Protocol =,=

 # Tried 3
 - Conform BaseAbility protocol
 - Implement default methods
 -> Results: 'Override method' worked
             'Don't need BaseView, BaseCollectionView, Base ....'
