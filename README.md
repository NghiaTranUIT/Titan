Movation
------------
At this time I'm wirting. I'm working at Pixai project (feels.com) as full-stack developer.  
Go-lang for backend. React-FB and redux for frontend. It's pretty struggle when I tried to find best postgresql client on macOS.
  
*Postico* is the best one I found, but it's missing  multi-tab, multi-connection in free version.  
*pgAdmin III* are the worst , GUI  seem like from 80s, and non-retina support.
  
After tried and deleted various similar apps. Finally, I prefer *PSequel*, clean design, straight-forward GUI, but it's still buggy sometime, and don't support multi-tab.

So ðŸ¤”. I make decision to write my own PostgreSQL client - called as **Titan**. It's the best place to apply what I've learnt to real product.
  
Technologies
------------
It's whole new project, I intent to use edge-technologies. I could start with MVC and old-fashionate technologies, but it's too boring.
  
*   Cross-framework: Support iOS and macOS.
*   ReSwift: Unidirectional data flow architecture. State-management easier.
*   RxSwift: Reactive Programming in Swift.
*   MVVM: Isolate logic code with UI code with MVVM architecture.
*   Base foundation and networking abstraction layers.
*   [Swifty-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/Swifty-PostgreSQL): Swifty-PostgreSQL driver, written by Swift 3.0
*   Swift 3.0
*   Realm.io for elegant storage persistence
*   ...

Titan Refactor 
------------
I created seperate repo for big refactor Titan's structure and logic.   
You can check the progress at [Titan](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/titan)
   
Roadmap
------------

Swifty PostgreSQL Driver
------------
Beside Titan, I also develop [PostgreSQL Dirver](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/Swifty-PostgreSQL), integrate flawlessly with Titan. Resueable, testable as well.
